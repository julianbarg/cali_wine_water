## Problem outline

> 1. Water sparsity
> 2. Search
> 3. Organic farming
>     - Change in water consumption pattern
>     - "Absolution"
> 4. Continued drought?
> 5. Search continues?

## Overview

1. Problem outline
2. Water and agriculture
3. The 2011-17 California drought
4. Organic farming
5. Viticulture

## 2. Water and agriculture

Rosegrant et al. (2009)

- 70% of global water withdrawals for agriculture
- 15%-35% nonsustainable groundwater withdrawals
- Other issues:
    - water pollution
    - climate change

## 3. The California drought

### Agriculture I 

(Cooley et al. 2015)

- Supplying 1/10 of US agricultural production (by value)
- Biggest agricultural exporter
- Absolute monopoly (in NA) on Olives, Walnuts, Artichokes, Dates etc.

---

### Agriculture II

> - Major contributor to US food self-sufficiency
>     - Potentially contributing to resilience
> - Far cry from progressive food system, e.g.
>     - Local food system (Martinez et al. 2010)
>     - Circular economy (Jurgilevich 2016)
>     - Food justice (Cadieux & Slocum 2015)

### Precipitation

## Water use{.smaller}

```{r water_use, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8}
cali_water <- read_csv("../data/cali_water.csv")
ylab <- c(7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5)
cali_water %>%
  group_by(Reporting_Month) %>%
  summarize(water_production = sum(Production_Reported)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Reporting_Month, y=water_production)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x=element_blank(), y="Water production (in billion gallons)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = paste0(ylab, "B"), breaks = 10^9 * ylab)
```

## 4. Organic farming

> - Drought and organic farming are independent phenomena
> - Drought could boost organic farming
> - Prohibits use of synthetic fertilizers and pestizides
> - No rules regarding water use
> - Could protect water sources through less pollution, soil protection
> - Could lead to system-wide increase of water consumption, bc lower yield per acre

## Disclaimer on (quantified) water consumption

> - Water can be extracted at any point, not all is measured
> - Water consumption =/= water consumption
>     - Grey water
>     - Polluted water
>     - Soil quality matters (water retention/evaporation)
> - Different water sources

## 5. Viticulture

> - Producer more prominent
> - Easy to match organic label with locality
> - Scale (number) in California lends itself to quantitative analysis

## Data

> - Name, location, date of:
>     - 4,032 vineyards/wineries
>     - 278 USDA certified vineyards/wineries
>     - 60 biodynamic vineyards/wineries
>     - 33 sustainable vineyards/wineries (LODI rules)
> - Circumference of "American Viticultural Areas"
> - Maps
> - Water production for California (subdivisions)
> - A pool of institutional knowledge from qualitative fieldwork (CA & CA)

## Outlook

> - Organic farming can address some environmental concerns - but there is no reason to believe it can address all concerns (Shennan et al. 2017)
> - If food suppy is threatened - how would organic farming be affected?
